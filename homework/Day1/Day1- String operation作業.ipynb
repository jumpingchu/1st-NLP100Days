       "'Wow,,, loved this place,/Crust is not good,/Not tasty and The texture was just nasty,/Stopped by during The late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it,/The selection on The menu was great and so were the prices,/Now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho,/Honeslty it didn\\'t taste that fresh,)/The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell They had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer,/The fries were great too,/A great touch,/Service was very prompt,/Would not go back,/The cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced,/I tried The cape cod ravoli, chicken, with cranberry,,,mmmm!/I was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair,/I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only,/Highly recommended,/Waitress was a little slow in service,/This place is not worth your time, let alone vegas,/Did not like at all,/The burrittos blah!/The food, amazing,/Service is also cute,/I could care less,,, The interior is just beautiful,/So They performed,/That\\'s right,,,,The red velvet cake,,,,,ohhh this stuff is so good,/- They never brought a salad we asked for,/This hole in The wall has great mexican street tacos, and friendly staff,/Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm, our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed,/The worst was The salmon sashimi,/Also There are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal,/This was like The final blow!/I found this place by accident and i could not be happier,/Seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere,/Overall, i like this place a lot,/The only redeeming quality of The restaurant was that it was very inexpensive,/Ample portions and good prices,/Poor service, The waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table,/My first visit to hiro was a delight!/Service sucks,/The shrimp tender and moist,/There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again,/Hard to judge wheTher these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn\\'t want to eat it for fear of getting sick,/On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service,/Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of The worst people behind the register,/The only thing i did like was The prime rib and dessert section,/It\\'s too bad The food is so damn generic,/The burger is good beef, cooked just right,/If you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse!!!!!/My side greek salad with The greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing,/We ordered The duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside,/He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on The table,/Their chow mein is so good!/They have horrible
